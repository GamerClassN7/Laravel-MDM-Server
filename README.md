# Laravel-MDM

A simple, self-hosted portal for keeping an eye on your Windows and Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)
computers: free disk space, pending updates, services, Docker containers, disk health and more.
A lightweight PowerShell agent on each device reports to the portal and takes commands from it.

![Device detail](docs/screenshots/device.png)

## Quick start

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mdm:
    image: ghcr.io/gamerclassn7/laravel-mdm-server:latest
    container_name: mdm
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - storage:/var/www/storage
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  storage:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://<server>:8000`, create the first account (it becomes the system admin) and click
**Add device**. No `.env` and no database server are needed: SQLite, keys and logs live in the
`storage` volume. For access from outside your network, put it behind a TLS proxy
(see [Server](docs/server.md#docker)).

## Add a device

**Add device** in the portal shows a ready-made command for Windows PowerShell and for PowerShell 7
(Windows, Debian / Ubuntu). Run it as Administrator / root and the device appears in the portal.
Details: [Installing the agent](docs/installation.md).

## What it does

- **Monitoring:** CPU and RAM history, drives, networks, battery, services, Docker, S.M.A.R.T.
- **Updates:** Windows Update, winget, apt, flatpak, snap and PowerShell modules, installed from the portal.
- **Commands:** restart, turn off, Wake-on-LAN, delivered instantly over a WebSocket.
- **Alerts:** per device and rule, sent to ntfy, Discord, Telegram, e-mail and more.
- **Also:** ping-only devices, a network map, remediation scripts, a security scanner, dashboards.
