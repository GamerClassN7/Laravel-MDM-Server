/**
 * A rule of the scanner that holds on a device. Findings of the inventory are resolved when the
 * next inventory does not match anymore; findings of events (they happened, nothing makes them
 * go away) are resolved by acknowledging them. An acknowledged finding of the inventory stays
 * open, quiet (no alert), until it is gone.
 *
 * A finding from a port scan (source "portscan") is of a scanned host that may not be a managed
 * device: device_id is null then and the host is kept as target_ip / target_mac in its network
 * (target_ip / network / site). Such findings show only in the fleet Security section; findings
 * with a device_id show there and on the device, and keep the device alert flow.
