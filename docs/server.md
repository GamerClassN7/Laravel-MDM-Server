# Server

```bash
cd src/laravel
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
npm install && npm run build
```

Open the portal and create the first account on the setup page. Without `APP_SYSTEM_ADMINS` the
first user (ID 1) is the system admin; set `APP_SYSTEM_ADMINS` in `.env` to a comma-separated list of
user IDs to choose others. Users and new passwords can also be set from the command line:

```bash
php artisan mdm:user admin@example.com            # asks for the password
docker exec -it mdm php artisan mdm:user admin@example.com
```

The user interface is in English, Czech, German, Spanish, French and Italian (`lang/*.json`). The
setup page asks for the language of the first account, which is also the default for everyone who
has not picked one; each user changes their own in the profile. Logs, alerts and notifications
stay in English.

Installations from before the setup page got a default account (`the-email@example.com` /
`the-password-of-choice`). Change its e-mail and password in the profile; the portal warns after
logging in with that password.

Run the scheduler every minute (it removes CPU/RAM history older than 7 days and runs backups;
the Docker image runs it for you):

```cron
* * * * * cd /path/to/src/laravel && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Docker

A small Alpine-based image (running as a non-root user) is built by GitHub Actions and published to
`ghcr.io/panoptipulse/laravel-mdm-server`. A single container runs everything under supervisord:

| Process | Description | Disable with |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| nginx + PHP-FPM | Web application on port 8000, migrations run on start | `RUN_MIGRATIONS=false` skips migrations |
| Reverb | WebSocket server, served by nginx on the same port under `/app` | `REVERB_ENABLED=false` |
| Queue worker | `php artisan queue:work --queue=security,default`: background jobs (security collections of the agents, rules feed) | `QUEUE_ENABLED=false` (jobs then run once the response has been sent) |
| Scheduler | `php artisan schedule:work` | `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` |

`docker-compose.yml` runs the image with SQLite and no settings (see [Quick start](../README.md#quick-start)).
Settings are passed as `environment:` of the service, e.g. `APP_SYSTEM_ADMINS: 1,2`. For MySQL:

```bash
cp src/laravel/.env.example src/laravel/.env   # set DB_*
docker compose -f docker-compose.mysql.yml --env-file src/laravel/.env up -d
```

Links are `https` behind a TLS proxy (any domain name). Opened directly by an IP address or
`localhost` over plain `http` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8000`), they stay `http`.

Only port 8000 is exposed: nginx serves the web and proxies `/app` (agent WebSockets) to Reverb
inside the container. No Reverb settings are needed: the app publishes to Reverb directly inside the
container, and agents connect to `/app` at the address they reach the server on (e.g.
`wss://mdm.example.com/app` behind a TLS proxy such as Nginx Proxy Manager with WebSocket support
enabled).

On start the container waits for the database and runs the migrations. `APP_KEY`, `REVERB_APP_KEY`
and `REVERB_APP_SECRET` are generated on the first start when they are not set, and kept in
`storage/secrets.env` in the `storage` volume, so they stay the same across restarts and updates.
Values set in the environment always take precedence. Uploaded files and logs are stored in the
`storage` volume.

Without `DB_CONNECTION` (or with `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`) and no `DB_DATABASE`, the database is SQLite
in the `storage` volume (`storage/database.sqlite`). A volume mounted over `/var/www/database` keeps working: its
`database.sqlite` is used, and on every start the migrations in it are replaced with the ones
from the image, so new migrations are applied after an update.

The application logs to daily files in the `storage` volume (`storage/logs`, shown in
**System → Logs**) and to `docker logs` at the same time. Another file channel in the environment or
in `.env` (e.g. `LOG_CHANNEL=single`) is used instead of the daily files; `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr` logs
to `docker logs` only. Database backups from the system pages are not supported in the image (no
`mysqldump`).

## Real-time commands (WebSocket)

Commands (turn off, restart, install updates) are pushed to agents instantly over a WebSocket
using [Laravel Reverb](https://laravel.com/docs/reverb). Without it, commands are delivered with
the agent's next periodic report.

Reverb is required for the portal: its pages never poll. When something about a device changes (a
report, a heartbeat, the progress of a command, a ping, a script result, an alert, a device going
offline) the server announces it on the private `devices` channel (only the device id), and the
components showing that device reload (`resources/js/live.js`, Laravel Echo). Open menus and
forms stay as they are. Browsers connect to the address of the portal under `/app` (the Docker
image proxies it), or to `REVERB_HOST` / `REVERB_PORT` / `REVERB_SCHEME` when they name a public
address.

1. Set `REVERB_APP_KEY` and `REVERB_APP_SECRET` in `.env` to random strings.
2. Point `REVERB_HOST`, `REVERB_PORT` and `REVERB_SCHEME` to where the app publishes to Reverb
   (`127.0.0.1:8080` on the same machine). Agents 1.16.0+ always connect to `/app` at the address
   of the portal, older ones to these values when they are public.
3. Keep the Reverb server running, e.g. with Supervisor (the Docker image already does):

   ```bash
   php artisan reverb:start
   ```

4. Without Docker, forward the `/app` (WebSocket) and `/apps` paths to Reverb, e.g. for nginx:

   ```nginx
   location /app/ {
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
       proxy_read_timeout 1h;
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
   }

   location /apps/ {
       proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
   }
   ```

The portal can be installed as an app (PWA, `steelants/laravel-general`): open it in Chrome,
Edge or Safari over HTTPS and choose *Install* / *Add to Home Screen*. The service worker caches
nothing but an offline page. Change the icon with
`php artisan pwa:make-icons --icon=resources/images/icon.png` (the vector source is
`resources/images/icon.svg`, also served as `favicon.svg`).
